This library is meant to access the EVE Online ESI API through a C# library. This library was built using .NET Standard so as to be compatible with as many .NET frameworks as possible.

## Version scheme
Versions released on NuGet will follow this structure:
{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}

Major will be incremented whenever there is a change affecting the design of the library and also when end-points have been removed.
Minor will be incremented whenever new or updated end-points are added and there haven't been any end-points that have been removed, which would warrant a major increment.
Patch will be incremented for things like fixing bugs that don't impact the usage of the library.

New features will likely fall under minor unless it changes the design.

## Example of how the library works
### Just using non-authorized API
### Using Authorized API and getting authorized
## Explanation of design decisions made for SSO and API routes
